# Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on my analysis of the existing project documents, this is a **greenfield project** with specific technical decisions already made:

**Current Project State:**
- **Project Name:** SimpleTasks TODO-list
- **Technology Stack:** Already defined in PRD (React 18+ TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, FullCalendar.js, @dnd-kit/core)
- **Architecture Pattern:** Client-side only monolith with localStorage persistence for MVP
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with atomic design component organization already planned

**Pre-configured Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Frontend Framework:** React 18+ with TypeScript (for concurrent features and type safety)
2. **Build Tool:** Vite (fast development, optimized production builds)
3. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens defined in UX specs
4. **Animation:** Framer Motion for celebration animations and micro-interactions
5. **Calendar:** FullCalendar.js integration for drag-and-drop functionality
6. **Drag-and-Drop:** @dnd-kit/core for modern, accessible drag operations
7. **State Management:** React Context + useReducer (sufficient for MVP scope)

**Design System Foundation:**
- Color palette, typography, and spacing already defined
- Component architecture following atomic design principles
- Accessibility-first approach with WCAG AA compliance requirements

**Constraints to Retain:**
- Client-side only architecture (no backend for MVP)
- localStorage persistence with migration path to backend
- Performance budgets: <2s load time, 60fps animations
- Desktop-first responsive design approach

Since the technology stack and architectural patterns are comprehensively defined in the PRD, we'll proceed with these established choices rather than suggesting alternative starter templates.
