# Components

Based on the atomic design patterns, React tech stack, and celebration-driven user experience requirements, I've identified the major logical components across the fullstack application:

## Task Management Engine

**Responsibility:** Core business logic for task CRUD operations, localStorage persistence, and state management with backend-ready architecture.

**Key Interfaces:**
- `TaskRepository` - Abstract storage operations (localStorage â†’ future API)
- `TaskService` - Business logic for task operations and validation  
- `TaskContext` - React state management with useReducer patterns

**Dependencies:** Data Models (Task, ApplicationState), localStorage API, validation utilities

**Technology Stack:** React Context + useReducer, custom localStorage wrapper with quota monitoring, Zod validation schemas for runtime type safety

## Gesture Interaction System

**Responsibility:** Handle complex gesture-based task completion including progress bar holds, swipe detection, and drag-and-drop operations with 60fps performance.

**Key Interfaces:**
- `GestureDetector` - Unified gesture recognition and event handling
- `ProgressBarController` - Hold-to-complete animation and state management
- `SwipeGestureHandler` - Touch and mouse swipe detection with momentum

**Dependencies:** Task Management Engine, Celebration System, Performance Monitoring

**Technology Stack:** @dnd-kit/core for drag operations, custom gesture detection with requestAnimationFrame, Framer Motion for smooth progress animations

## Calendar Integration Hub  

**Responsibility:** Unified dashboard with drag-and-drop task scheduling, calendar rendering, and seamless task-to-calendar workflow management.

**Key Interfaces:**
- `CalendarRenderer` - FullCalendar.js integration with custom styling
- `SchedulingController` - Drag-and-drop task scheduling logic
- `CalendarTaskSync` - Bidirectional updates between task list and calendar

**Dependencies:** Task Management Engine, Gesture Interaction System, date-fns utilities

**Technology Stack:** FullCalendar.js 6.1+ with custom theming, @dnd-kit/core for drag operations, date-fns for date manipulation, custom drop zone validation

## Celebration Animation Engine

**Responsibility:** GPU-accelerated celebration animations with randomization, accessibility alternatives, and performance monitoring for 60fps requirement.

**Key Interfaces:**
- `CelebrationOrchestrator` - Animation selection and lifecycle management
- `AnimationRenderer` - GPU-optimized animation execution
- `AccessibilityAdapter` - Reduced motion alternatives and haptic feedback

**Dependencies:** Task Management Engine (completion events), Performance Monitoring

**Technology Stack:** Framer Motion with GPU acceleration, Web Animation API fallbacks, custom particle systems, haptic feedback via Vibration API

## Social Sharing Connector

**Responsibility:** Web Share API integration for task completion sharing with platform-specific formatting and privacy controls.

**Key Interfaces:**
- `ShareManager` - Web Share API abstraction and fallback handling
- `ContentGenerator` - Platform-specific share content formatting
- `PrivacyController` - User privacy preferences and sensitive content filtering

**Dependencies:** Task Management Engine (completion data), User Settings

**Technology Stack:** Web Share API with fallback to clipboard, custom share templates, privacy validation utilities

## Performance Monitoring System

**Responsibility:** Client-side performance tracking for animation frame rates, localStorage operations, and user interaction metrics.

**Key Interfaces:**
- `PerformanceTracker` - Web Vitals and custom metrics collection
- `AnimationMonitor` - Real-time FPS monitoring during celebrations
- `StorageMonitor` - localStorage quota usage and performance tracking

**Dependencies:** All other components (cross-cutting concern)

**Technology Stack:** web-vitals library, Performance Observer API, custom frame rate monitoring, localStorage quota detection

**Component Integration Strategy:**
- **Centralized State:** Task Management Engine serves as single source of truth
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Components communicate via custom events and React Context
- **Dependency Injection:** Abstract interfaces enable easy testing and future backend integration
- **Performance-First:** Cross-cutting performance monitoring ensures 60fps compliance

**Detailed Rationale:**
- **Design Decisions:** Domain-driven component boundaries prepare for potential microservice split while maintaining monorepo simplicity
- **Technology Alignment:** Each component leverages specific technologies from the defined tech stack for optimal performance
- **Future-Proofing:** Clean interfaces and dependency abstraction enable seamless Phase 2 backend integration
- **Performance Focus:** Performance monitoring as first-class component ensures celebration and gesture requirements are met
