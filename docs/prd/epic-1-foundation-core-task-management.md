# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Task Management

**Epic Goal:** Establish a production-ready React application with TypeScript, implement core task management functionality (create, read, update, delete), and set up localStorage persistence. This epic delivers immediate user value by enabling basic task management while establishing the technical foundation for all future features.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
As a **developer**,
I want **a fully configured React TypeScript project with development tools**,
so that **I can efficiently develop features with confidence and maintain code quality**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create React application with TypeScript and Vite build tool
2. Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Husky pre-commit hooks
3. Set up basic folder structure following atomic design principles
4. Install and configure Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
5. Set up Jest and React Testing Library with comprehensive test configuration
   - Configure Jest with Vite integration and TypeScript support
   - Set up React Testing Library with custom render utilities
   - Create test setup files with DOM environment configuration
   - Add test scripts and coverage reporting configuration
6. Install and configure essential external libraries for future epics
   - Framer Motion (10.16+) for celebration animations in Epic 2
   - FullCalendar (6.1+) for calendar integration in Epic 3
   - @dnd-kit/core (6.0+) for drag-and-drop functionality in Epic 3
   - date-fns (2.30+) for date manipulation utilities
   - Configure library-specific TypeScript declarations and setup
7. Create basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for linting and testing
8. Deploy basic "Hello World" application to Netlify with automatic deployments
9. Validate browser compatibility requirements and document fallback strategies

**Technical Implementation:** Vite config with TypeScript strict mode, path aliases, environment variables. Tailwind config with custom color palette, spacing scale, animation utilities. ESLint rules: React hooks, TypeScript strict, accessibility plugin. GitHub Actions workflow: Node.js 18, cache npm dependencies, parallel linting/testing.

## Story 1.2: Core Task Data Model and Storage
As a **user**,
I want **my tasks to persist between browser sessions**,
so that **I don't lose my work when I close and reopen the application**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Define TypeScript interfaces for Task entity (id, title, completed, priority, createdAt, scheduledDate)
2. Implement localStorage service with JSON serialization/deserialization
3. Create React Context for task state management with useReducer
4. Add error handling for localStorage quota exceeded scenarios
5. Implement data validation for task objects before storage
6. Create utility functions for data migration and version compatibility
7. Add basic task CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) in context
8. Handle localStorage corruption with graceful fallback and data recovery
9. Implement incremental backup to prevent total data loss
10. Add localStorage quota monitoring with user warnings at 80% capacity

**Technical Implementation:** Repository pattern with interface abstraction for future backend migration. Zod schemas for runtime task validation and type safety. React Context with immer for immutable state updates. Custom hooks: useLocalStorage, useTaskOperations, useTaskFilters.

## Story 1.3: Basic Task List Interface
As a **user**,
I want **to see all my tasks in a clean, organized list**,
so that **I can quickly understand what needs to be done**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create TaskCard component displaying task title, creation date, and priority
2. Implement TaskList component with proper loading and empty states
3. Display tasks in reverse chronological order (newest first)
4. Add hover effects and basic interaction states for task cards
5. Show task count and basic statistics (total tasks, completed tasks)
6. Implement responsive design that works on desktop and tablet
7. Ensure keyboard navigation support for accessibility

**Component Architecture:** TaskCard: memo-wrapped for performance, forwarded refs for animations. TaskList: virtualization-ready structure, intersection observer for lazy loading. Empty states: illustrations with call-to-action for task creation.

## Story 1.4: Task Creation Interface
As a **user**,
I want **to quickly create new tasks with minimal friction**,
so that **I can capture ideas and todos without interrupting my workflow**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create inline task creation input that appears on demand
2. Support Enter key to save task and Escape key to cancel
3. Implement auto-focus on task input when creation is initiated
4. Add basic input validation (non-empty, character limits)
5. Provide immediate visual feedback for successful task creation
6. Auto-clear input field after successful task creation
7. Handle edge cases like duplicate task names gracefully
8. Prevent task creation with only whitespace characters
9. Handle extremely long task titles with truncation and tooltips
10. Support paste operations with automatic text cleaning

## Story 1.5: Binary Priority System
As a **user**,
I want **to mark tasks as important or not important**,
so that **I can prioritize my work without analysis paralysis**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Add star icon toggle for marking tasks as important
2. Visually distinguish important tasks with color and icon styling
3. Allow priority toggling from both task list and during creation
4. Persist priority status in localStorage with task data
5. Sort tasks with important items appearing first in lists
6. Provide clear visual feedback for priority state changes
7. Ensure priority toggle is accessible via keyboard navigation

**Story Dependencies (CRITICAL SEQUENCING):** 
- **1.1 (Infrastructure)** → **1.2 (Data Model)** → **1.3 (UI Display)** + **1.4 (Creation Interface)** → **1.5 (Priority System)**
- **BLOCKING REQUIREMENT:** Story 1.2 must be 100% complete before starting 1.3 or 1.4
- **PARALLEL EXECUTION:** Stories 1.3 and 1.4 can run in parallel after 1.2 completion
- **VALIDATION:** All data persistence and Context patterns must be tested before UI implementation

**Development Effort:** 23 story points (2-3 weeks)

**Critical Sequencing Rationale:**
- Story 1.1 provides all infrastructure and external library setup required for subsequent stories
- Story 1.2 establishes data models and storage patterns that 1.3 and 1.4 depend upon
- Stories 1.3 and 1.4 both consume the Context and data operations defined in 1.2
- Story 1.5 builds upon the UI components and data operations from all previous stories
