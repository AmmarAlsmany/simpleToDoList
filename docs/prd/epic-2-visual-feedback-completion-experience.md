# Epic 2: Visual Feedback & Completion Experience

**Epic Goal:** Transform the standard task completion experience into a satisfying, engaging interaction that differentiates SimpleTasks from competitors. Implement multiple completion methods (progress bars, swipe gestures), celebration animations, and social sharing capabilities that make task completion addictive and provide social accountability features.

## Story 2.1: Progress Bar Completion Method
As a **user**,
I want **to complete tasks by holding down a progress bar**,
so that **I feel a satisfying sense of progression and completion**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Replace traditional checkboxes with interactive progress bars on task cards
2. Implement hold-to-complete interaction: click and hold fills progress bar 0-100%
3. Release at 100% triggers task completion with smooth animation
4. Release before 100% resets progress bar with bounce animation
5. Provide haptic feedback on supported devices during progress
6. Add visual cues (color changes, scaling) during interaction
7. Ensure accessibility with keyboard alternative (space bar hold) and screen reader support

## Story 2.2: Swipe Gesture Completion
As a **user**,
I want **to complete tasks by swiping right**,
so that **I have a quick, natural way to mark items as done**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement right swipe gesture detection on task cards with touch and mouse support
2. Show visual feedback during swipe: task card slides right, reveals checkmark background
3. Complete swipe (>60% card width) triggers completion, partial swipe bounces back
4. Add momentum-based animation for natural feel
5. Prevent accidental swipes with minimum velocity threshold
6. Disable swipe on important tasks without explicit confirmation
7. Provide visual tutorial overlay for first-time users

## Story 2.3: Celebration Animation System
As a **user**,
I want **to see delightful animations when I complete tasks**,
so that **I feel rewarded and motivated to continue being productive**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create celebration animation library: confetti burst, checkmark hero, progress fireworks, achievement badge
2. Randomly select celebration type for variety and surprise
3. Trigger celebration immediately after task completion (2-3 second duration)
4. Animate celebration elements using GPU-accelerated transforms
5. Include sound effects with user preference controls
6. Provide reduced motion accessibility option (simple color change + haptic)
7. Scale celebration intensity based on task importance and completion streaks

## Story 2.4: Social Sharing Integration
As a **user**,
I want **to share my completed tasks on social media**,
so that **I can celebrate achievements and maintain social accountability**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement robust sharing system with Web Share API and fallback strategy
   - **Primary:** Web Share API for native platform sharing (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
   - **Fallback:** Copy-to-clipboard with manual share instructions for unsupported browsers
   - **Detection:** Browser feature detection to automatically select appropriate method
   - **User Feedback:** Clear visual indication of which sharing method is active
2. Present share dialog immediately after celebration animation
3. Generate shareable content: task title, completion message, optional statistics
4. Support major platforms with optimized content formatting
   - **Web Share API:** Native platform-specific formatting
   - **Fallback:** Pre-formatted text optimized for manual paste to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
5. Allow users to customize share message templates with live preview
6. Include comprehensive privacy controls
   - Opt-out sharing entirely (global setting)
   - Mark sensitive tasks as non-shareable
   - Review sharing content before posting
7. Track sharing engagement for motivational statistics (local only)
8. **Browser Compatibility Testing:** Validate functionality across target browsers
   - Test Web Share API availability and behavior
   - Test clipboard API functionality and permissions
   - Provide graceful degradation for older browsers

## Story 2.5: Completion Methods Integration
As a **user**,
I want **all completion methods to work seamlessly together**,
so that **I can choose my preferred interaction method in any situation**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Ensure progress bar, swipe, and traditional click completion methods coexist
2. Provide user preferences for enabling/disabling specific completion methods
3. Maintain consistent celebration and sharing flow regardless of completion method
4. Handle edge cases: simultaneous gesture attempts, method conflicts
5. Persist user preferences for completion method selection
6. Add contextual method suggestions based on device capabilities
7. Ensure all methods trigger identical backend operations and state updates
