# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a refreshingly simple to-do application that eliminates feature bloat while maintaining user engagement
- Replace traditional checkboxes with satisfying visual feedback mechanisms (progress bars, swipe gestures, celebration animations)
- Seamlessly integrate task management with calendar scheduling through drag-and-drop functionality
- Provide immediate usability without account creation or complex setup requirements
- Enable social accountability through optional task completion sharing
- Support decision-making with built-in prioritization assistance
- Achieve 1,000 daily active users within 6 months with 70%+ retention rate

## Background Context
Traditional to-do applications overwhelm users with feature complexity, leading to abandonment in favor of basic note-taking apps. Users struggle with unintuitive interfaces requiring significant setup time, lack of satisfying completion feedback, and poor calendar integration. SimpleTasks addresses this market gap by focusing on core functionality while delivering engaging user experiences through visual feedback and seamless scheduling integration. The solution targets productivity-conscious professionals and students aged 25-45 who value aesthetic design and smooth user experiences but have been frustrated by existing complex solutions.
