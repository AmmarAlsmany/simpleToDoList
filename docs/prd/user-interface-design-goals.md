# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a visually delightful, minimalist interface that makes task management feel rewarding rather than burdensome. The design should eliminate cognitive overhead while providing satisfying micro-interactions that encourage continued use. Focus on immediate usability with zero onboarding complexity.

**User Journey Flow:** Entry → Task Creation (inline input) → Priority Setting (binary toggle) → Scheduling (drag to calendar) → Execution (swipe/progress bar) → Celebration (full-screen animation) → Social Sharing (native dialog)

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Drag-and-drop scheduling:** Tasks seamlessly move between list and calendar views with magnetic snap zones and visual feedback
- **Gesture-based completion:** Multiple completion methods - swipe-to-complete, progress bar hold, drag to "Done" zone
- **Celebration-driven feedback:** Randomized completion animations (confetti burst, checkmark hero, progress fireworks, achievement badges)
- **One-click social sharing:** Immediate sharing of accomplishments through Web Share API integration

**Gesture Library:**
- Progress bar: Click and hold to animate 0-100%, release at 100% to complete
- Swipe gesture: Right swipe on task triggers slide animation with checkmark reveal
- Drag feedback: Semi-transparent task with target highlighting and bounce-back for invalid drops

## Core Screens and Views
- **Unified Dashboard:** Combined task list (left) and calendar (right) with seamless drag-and-drop functionality
- **Task Creation Modal:** Inline single-field input with optional binary priority toggle (star icon)
- **Completion Celebration Screen:** 2-3 second full-screen animations with accessibility alternatives
- **Social Sharing Dialog:** Quick sharing interface integrated with native Web Share API
- **Settings/Export Panel:** Minimal configuration and JSON/CSV data export options

**Visual Design Tokens:**
- Colors: Primary #4F46E5, Success #059669, Warning #D97706, Background #F9FAFB
- Typography: Inter font family (600/500/400 weights)
- Spacing: 4px base unit system (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
- Animations: ease-out micro-interactions, spring celebrations, ease-in-out drag operations

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards for visual feedback systems with animation disable options, color-blind friendly design patterns, keyboard navigation support (2px indigo outline with 4px offset), and haptic feedback alternatives.

## Branding
Minimalist aesthetic inspired by modern productivity tools with emphasis on satisfaction-driven micro-interactions. Clean Inter typography, subtle shadows, and smooth animation curves that feel premium but not overwhelming. Differentiates from competitors through celebration-first design approach rather than feature complexity.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-first responsive design optimized for productivity workflows, with tablet support for drag-and-drop interactions. Mobile-friendly interface but not mobile-native in MVP phase. Performance optimized for 60fps animations using transform/opacity properties and requestAnimationFrame.
