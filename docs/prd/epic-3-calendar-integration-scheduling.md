# Epic 3: Calendar Integration & Scheduling

**Epic Goal:** Create a unified dashboard that seamlessly combines task management with calendar scheduling through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. Enable users to transform their task list into a time-blocked schedule while maintaining the simplicity that defines the application's core value proposition.

## Story 3.1: Calendar View Component
As a **user**,
I want **to see a calendar view alongside my task list**,
so that **I can visualize my schedule and plan when to work on tasks**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement FullCalendar.js integration with custom SimpleTasks styling
2. Display week view and month view options with smooth transitions
3. Show current date highlighting and navigation controls
4. Integrate with design system: colors, typography, spacing consistent with task list
5. Support keyboard navigation for accessibility (arrow keys, tab order)
6. Display scheduled tasks as calendar events with task metadata
7. Ensure responsive behavior on desktop and tablet screen sizes

## Story 3.2: Unified Dashboard Layout
As a **user**,
I want **to see my task list and calendar side by side**,
so that **I can efficiently manage both my todos and my schedule in one view**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create split-screen layout: task list (left 40%) and calendar (right 60%)
2. Implement responsive breakpoints: stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
3. Add resizable divider for user preference customization
4. Ensure both components maintain full functionality in constrained space
5. Optimize performance for simultaneous rendering of both views
6. Preserve layout preferences in localStorage for consistency across sessions
7. Handle overflow scenarios gracefully (scrolling, pagination)

## Story 3.3: Drag-and-Drop Task Scheduling
As a **user**,
I want **to drag tasks from my list directly onto calendar dates**,
so that **I can schedule work time without complex forms or additional steps**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement @dnd-kit drag-and-drop with task cards as draggable elements
2. Highlight calendar drop zones during drag operation with visual feedback
3. Support dropping on specific dates (all-day tasks) and time slots (timed tasks)
4. Provide snap-to-grid functionality for time-based scheduling
5. Show task preview during drag with semi-transparent styling
6. Handle invalid drop targets with bounce-back animation
7. Update task scheduling immediately with optimistic UI updates

## Story 3.4: Scheduled Task Management
As a **user**,
I want **to modify, reschedule, and unschedule tasks from the calendar**,
so that **I can adapt my schedule as priorities change**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Enable drag-to-reschedule directly within calendar view
2. Implement right-click context menu for task operations (edit, delete, unschedule)
3. Allow time duration editing for scheduled tasks with visual duration indicators
4. Support unscheduling tasks (drag back to task list or dedicated unscheduled zone)
5. Provide bulk scheduling operations for multiple selected tasks
6. Handle scheduling conflicts with user confirmation dialogs
7. Maintain task completion status when rescheduling

## Story 3.5: Calendar Task Completion
As a **user**,
I want **to complete tasks directly from the calendar view**,
so that **I can mark work done without switching between list and calendar views**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Display completion methods (progress bar, right-click) on calendar task events
2. Trigger same celebration animations as list-based completion
3. Update both calendar and task list views immediately upon completion
4. Show completed tasks in calendar with distinct visual styling (strikethrough, faded)
5. Provide option to hide/show completed tasks in calendar view
6. Maintain completion statistics across both views
7. Enable undo completion from calendar context menu
