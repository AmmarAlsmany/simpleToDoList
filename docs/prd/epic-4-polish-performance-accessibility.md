# Epic 4: Polish, Performance & Accessibility

**Epic Goal:** Transform the functional application into a production-ready, performant, and accessible solution that meets professional standards. Optimize for 60fps animations, implement comprehensive accessibility compliance, add data export functionality, and ensure the application performs excellently under real-world usage conditions.

## Story 4.1: Animation Performance Optimization
As a **user**,
I want **all animations to be smooth and responsive**,
so that **the application feels professional and delightful to use**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Achieve 60fps performance for all celebration animations across target browsers
2. Implement GPU acceleration using transform and opacity properties exclusively
3. Add performance monitoring with frame rate measurements in development
4. Optimize animation timing functions for natural, satisfying motion curves
5. Implement animation queuing to prevent overlapping performance issues
6. Add performance budgets and automated testing for animation smoothness
7. Provide reduced motion preferences with instant feedback alternatives

## Story 4.2: Large Dataset Performance
As a **user**,
I want **the application to remain fast even with hundreds of tasks**,
so that **I can scale my productivity without performance degradation**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement virtual scrolling for task lists exceeding 100 items
2. Add pagination or infinite scroll for calendar views with many scheduled tasks
3. Optimize localStorage operations with debounced writes and read caching
4. Implement task search and filtering for efficient large dataset navigation
5. Add performance testing with 1000+ task scenarios
6. Monitor and optimize bundle size with automated bundle analysis
7. Implement lazy loading for non-critical features (settings, export)

## Story 4.3: WCAG AA Accessibility Compliance
As a **user with accessibility needs**,
I want **to use all application features with assistive technologies**,
so that **I can be productive regardless of my abilities**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Ensure all interactive elements have proper ARIA labels and roles
2. Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation for all features
3. Provide screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes
4. Meet color contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
5. Add focus indicators that meet visibility requirements
6. Test with actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
7. Implement automated accessibility testing in CI pipeline

## Story 4.4: Data Export and Backup
As a **user**,
I want **to export my tasks and settings**,
so that **I can backup my data and migrate between browsers or devices**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement JSON export for complete task data with metadata
2. Add CSV export for spreadsheet compatibility and analysis
3. Support selective export (date ranges, completed/incomplete, priority levels)
4. Create import functionality for data restoration and migration
5. Include data validation for imported files with error reporting
6. Provide export scheduling options (manual, automatic weekly)
7. Add export confirmation with data preview before download

## Story 4.5: Production Deployment & Monitoring
As a **product owner**,
I want **comprehensive monitoring and deployment automation**,
so that **I can ensure application reliability and performance in production**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Set up production deployment pipeline with staging and production environments
2. Implement error tracking and monitoring (Sentry integration)
3. Add performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking
4. Configure automated testing in CI/CD with quality gates
5. Set up uptime monitoring and alerting for production deployment
6. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout capabilities
7. Create comprehensive documentation for deployment and maintenance procedures
